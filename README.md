All of the anomalies are made with customization in mind. It is highly recommended to read through each option to tweak it as per your requirement.
Health is calculated by number of 'hits' received from other units. 10 Health = Hits from projectile required to 'neutralize' the anomaly. Some anomalies have special property for termination. Please read them carefully.
