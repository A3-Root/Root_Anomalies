# ++++ ANOMALIES ++++

All anomalies are made with customization in mind. It is highly recommended to read through each option to tweak them as per your requirement. Health is calculated by the number of 'hits' received from other units. 10 Health = Hits from projectiles required to 'neutralize' the anomaly. Some anomalies have special termination properties. Please read carefully.
